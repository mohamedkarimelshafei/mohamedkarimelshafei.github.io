    Diamond rooms looks like this with potential entrances on it's single flat wall
    and cornices around the flat wall.

    Diamonds have a minimum size of 5 and their dimensions must
    be the same odd number (x, x) to keep the diagonal walls straight.

    If given a even sized dimension, the last row or column
    will be left blank and treated as if it wasn't part of the room.
