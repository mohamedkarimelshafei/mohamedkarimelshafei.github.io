module Utils.AStarCustom exposing (findPath)

{-| This is the real algorithm. The types are generalised here.

We publish simple types to the user which assume they're working with
a 2D grid.

But in reality, we aren't tied to (x,y) positions and we don't care
what the terrain model is. Positions can be any type you like (as long
as it's `comparable` so that we can use it as a dictionary
key).

But...that makes the type signatures pretty unintuitive to newer
users, so we hide them away here.

{-| Find a path between the `start` and `end` `Position`s. You must
supply a cost function and a move function.

See `AStar.findPath` for a getting-started guide. This is a more
general version of that same function.
