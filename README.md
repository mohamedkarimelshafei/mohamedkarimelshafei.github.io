# Castle of the Winds in Elm

Castle of the Winds is a tile-based RPG made by Rick Saada in the late 80s. Many old school RPGers remember the game with fond memories and as such, this is my [~~first~~](https://github.com/mordrax/CoTWjs/) [~~second~~](https://github.com/mordrax/cotwmtor) third attempt to port the game into the modern era to be playable on mobile and web browsers.

# Running from source

### First

Install [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/install) by itself or through node `npm i -g elm`

### \`andThen\`

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/mordrax/cotwelm/`
2. Run: `./build.sh` (it cleans `elm-stuff` and runs `elm make src/make.elm dist/js/cotw.js`)
3. Open: `dist/index.html` in your favourite browser (as long as it's Chrome)

### Contributing

If you'd like to hack on it, the `./dev.sh` script is nice to get auto refreshing of the browser. To do this you will need the `http-server` and `browser-sync` packages off npm as well. It should open up ports 5000 for elm reactor and 5008 for the html version with external semantic ui css.

I welcome suggestions for stats messages in the [character creation screen](http://game.castleofthewinds.com/#/charCreation)!
